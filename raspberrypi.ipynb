    "\n",
    "The diversity of platforms where Linux is used extends from small embedded systems to super computers and cloud systems. In this workshop we familiarize ourselves to one of the low-end platforms – Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is very popular among hobbyists, and it is also used in many R&D projects due to vast amount of software available to Linux and possibility to interface with sensors and actuators besides IP-network connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set-up a configuration where you can access Raspberry Pi -based server wirelessly from your computer. In this configuration you don’t need to connect a keyboard or display to Raspberry Pi. If you want to set-up desktop configuration, look at this ![information](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html).\n",
